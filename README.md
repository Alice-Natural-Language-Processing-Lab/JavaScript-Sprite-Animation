# Sprite Animation
A simple JavaScript Animation using HTML5 Canvas, see the animation at [https://amartinezacosta.github.io/Sprite-Animation/sprite.html](https://amartinezacosta.github.io/Sprite-Animation/sprite.html). This was made so that spritesheets can be loaded and drawn in frames (just typical animation stuff).
